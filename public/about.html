<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Natalie Blanco. I'm 26 years old and from Des Moines, Iowa.</p>

<p>I currently work at Principal Financial Group as a Customer Experience Specialist 2 in our Group Benefits Administration Contact Center.</p>

<p>I love spending my free time with my husband, daughter, and our two dogs enjoying family movie nights, last minute road trips, exploring our city Des Moines, vacationing, and more. As well as coding, of course.</p>
